# EpiCon
## Introduction
EpiCon is a computational method, proposes epigenetic controllability score to quantify the ability of TFs to open up closed chromatins for single cells and cell types, taking sc-multiome data as inputs. we proposenamed  We validated EpiCon using experimental datasets including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and TF knockdown data. We demonstrated that EpiCon distinguished TFs even when they belong to the same family and share identical motifs. EpiCon effectively integrates gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, as evidenced by the discovery of experimentally validated driver regulators that remained undetected in single-modality analyses. Our approach is broadly applicable to any sc-multiome data and is implemented in an open-source software EpiCon (https://github.com/durenlab/EpiCon), which is freely available.![image](https://github.com/Durenlab/EpiCon/assets/43508437/8dec2e2c-deb3-4189-a151-05a63f71bf59)
